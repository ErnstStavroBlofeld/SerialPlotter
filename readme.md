# Serial Plotter

Philipp Baszuk Copyright (c) 2020 MIT

Program for receiving and plotting serial port data
written in C++ using ImGui and OpenGL.

In current form it's not functional due to lack
of serial port communication implementation.

As per now project remains temporarily suspended, but I'm
planning to resume it sometime in future.
